# flowfact-testtask

This is a RESTful service, which should be able to delegate CRUD operations on addresses and phone numbers.
I'm using Spring here to build RESTful service and be able to use dependency injection. 
DAO layer, which would perform actual storage operations is being injected into RESTController, therefore is being replaceable.

Unfortunately, this is only a sketch of an actual program, but I'm unable to give it proper time and attention due to current tasks. Sorry for that.
